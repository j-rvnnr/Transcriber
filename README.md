Software for running transcription. 

Planned to have summarising features, and maybe diarisation too, as it's main purpose for me is to transcribe my dungeons and dragons sessions, so I have more complete notes at the end. 

Uses whisper library on GPU for maximum speed, using the "turbo" model. The correct file to run is interface_turbo_transcription
